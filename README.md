KURSI-OBJECT-DENTIFIER
Welcome to Kursi, a leading innovator in plastic recycling, dedicated to transforming waste into valuable, sustainable products. At our facility, we specialize in processing three types of plastic objects—black, transparent, and colorful. Our advanced recycling process begins with the efficient separation of these objects onto three distinct conveyor belts. This initial sorting ensures that each type of plastic is processed independently, maintaining purity and quality.

Once sorted, the plastics are crushed into small, manageable pieces. These crushed plastics are then meticulously molded into high-quality plastic chairs, available in black, transparent, and colorful varieties. By converting discarded plastics into functional and aesthetically pleasing chairs, we contribute to reducing environmental waste and promoting sustainability.

At Kursi, we believe in the power of recycling to create a cleaner, greener future. Our commitment to innovation and quality drives us to continuously improve our processes, ensuring that our products not only meet but exceed industry standards. Join us in our mission to turn waste into worth, one plastic chair at a time.

As a Critical thinker, you need to create an object identifier module that classify the object and sends it to the correct conveyor belt. The information is as follows:
•	Black object is sent to conveyor belt A
•	Transparent object is sent to conveyor belt B
•	Colorful object is sent to conveyor belt C
